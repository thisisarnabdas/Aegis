Python: https://www.python.org/ TensorFlow: https://www.tensorflow.org/ Scikit-learn: https://scikit-learn.org/

Project Description

This project implements an Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based Intrusion Detection System designed to safeguard networks by proactively identifying malicious activity differentiating it from normal traffic.

Key Features

    Enhanced Detection: Employs a meticulously trained ANN model for superior detection accuracy of network attacks.
    Data Preprocessing: Thorough data cleaning and normalization to optimize model performance.
    Dimensionality Reduction: Leverages techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for efficient feature representation.
    Customizable Architecture: Flexible ANN architecture adaptable to diverse network environments.
    Performance Visualization: Provides graphical insights into model training and evaluation metrics.
